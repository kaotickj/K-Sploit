>KSploit is a user friendly control panel in which to drive many metasploit tasks such as generating shells, payloads, and persistence scripts on the fly, starting listeners, and suggesting payloads and exploits. Requires metasploit framework https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework

#### Exploits, payloads, listeners for:
üñ•Windows üêß Linux üçé Mac ü§ñ Android
 
#### Shells:
Use the shells menu to quickly and easily craft shell code and scripts. Choose from Bash, PERL, Ruby, PHP, python and necat options.

#### Listeners:

Use the listeners menu to craft and quickly deploy metasploit listeners. Choose from Windows x86/x64, Linux x86/x64, Mac/OSX, Bash, Meterpreter, and Netcat listeners.

#### Payloads

Use the payloads menu to quickly and easily craft metasploit payloads for a wide variety of targets. Payload options for meterpreter, windows x86/x64, linux x86/x64, mac/osx, android, and python.  

### Windows Executable Payload Injection:

Use the windows executable injection menu to inject metasploit payloads into windows executables.

##### KSploit Mal-exe with Dialog:

##### Consider Dialog Notice

Relax, you didn't break it ... it's not an error, it's a suggestion.  If you would like a graphical interface to select files for injection, install "dialog" (https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/dialog).  Otherwise, you can just type the full path to the exe you want to inject (i.e., /home/user/pre-mal-exes/putty.exe) and hit "enter"
